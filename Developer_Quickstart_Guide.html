          </a>
          <p>From a simplified perspective, Rock is primarily made up of two
    parts, Theme Layouts and Blocks. Themes have layouts that control the
    placement and definition of content areas called "Zones" and also include
    the pieces that define the styling. Blocks are the fundamental, functional
    code-parts that make up an application, widget, control, module -- or
    whatever you you call them.</p>
          <p>When combined, Layouts and Blocks allow you to compose a powerful
    application. In fact, the ChMS parts of Rock are built using these very
    things. We like to say "Rock is built on Rock".</p>
          <br />
          <a style="padding-top:50px; display: block;" name="Blocks">
            <h1 class="page-header">Blocks</h1>
          </a>
          <p>Blocks are usually small pieces of HTML and code (your custom
    ASP.NET User Controls) and are the fundamental, functional "building
    blocks" that make up your plugin, widget, application or whatever you want
    to call it. They can include anything you want but they must
    inherit from the Rock.Web.UI.Block class as shown in the
    following example which is using a Code Behind file.</p>
          <p>
        An example Block (ExampleCustomBlock.ascx)

        
          
            
              
            
          
        
      <div class="well" style="background-color: white"><img src="images/ExampleBlock.png" /><br /><br /><caption><em styl="small">Figure: An example Block (ExampleCustomBlock.ascx)</em></caption></div></p>
          <p>
        The code-behind for the example Block
        (ExampleCustomBlock.ascx.cs)

        
          
            
              
            
          
        
      <div class="well" style="background-color: white"><img src="images/ExampleBlockCodeBehind.png" /><br /><br /><caption><em styl="small">Figure: The code-behind for the example Block
        (ExampleCustomBlock.ascx.cs)</em></caption></div></p>
          <p>The standard location for all custom blocks is in the Plugins
    folder. We recommend you create your own folder under the Plugins folder
    to hold any custom blocks created by your team:</p>
          <p>
        Location of Custom Blocks

        
          
            
              
            
          
        
      <div class="well" style="background-color: white"><img src="images/CustomBlockFolderLayout.png" /><br /><br /><caption><em styl="small">Figure: Location of Custom Blocks</em></caption></div></p>
          <br />
          <a style="padding-top:50px; display: block;" name="Theme Layouts">
            <h1 class="page-header">Theme Layouts</h1>
          </a>
          <p>
      A Theme Layout is really just HTML. It's simply an ASP.NET Web Page
      (.aspx) that basically defines zero or more "zones" where Blocks can
      reside and will also refer to css, javascripts, and images. Theme Layouts
      can include just about anything you wish, 
        but they must inherit
        from the Rock.Web.UI.Page class
       as shown in the following
      example.
    </p>
          <p>
      
        
          An example Theme Layout, Splash.aspx, which has a single
          Zone
        

        
      
    <div class="well" style="background-color: white"><img src="images/ExampleThemeLayout_Splash.png" /><br /><br /><caption><em styl="small">Figure: 
          An example Theme Layout, Splash.aspx, which has a single
          Zone
        </em></caption></div></p>
          <p>
      
        Code behind file (Splash.aspx.cs) for the Splash layout

        
          
            
              
            
          
        
      
    <div class="well" style="background-color: white"><img src="images/ExampleThemeLayout_SplashCodeBehind.png" /><br /><br /><caption><em styl="small">Figure: Code behind file (Splash.aspx.cs) for the Splash layout</em></caption></div></p>
          <p>
      Notice how a single Zone named "Content" is added by defining a
      DefineZones() method which is overridden from the parent Rock.Web.UI.Page
      class. Any ASP control that can have child controls (such as the
      asp:PlaceHolder) can be used as a zone.
    </p>
          <p>
      The recommended folder structure for any custom themes you create
      should be similar to the default RockCMS theme which
      has four layouts (Default, Dialog, OneColumn, and Splash) as shown
      below.
    </p>
          <p>
      
        Sample folder structure for the RockCMS theme

        
          
            
          
        
      
      <div class="well" style="background-color: white"><img src="images/ThemeFolderLayout.png" /><br /><br /><caption><em styl="small">Figure: Sample folder structure for the RockCMS theme</em></caption></div></p>
          <p>
      We also recommend an Assets folder be used to store any fonts,
      icons and images your theme uses. Likewise, the CSS and Scripts folder
      would be used to store stylesheets and any JavaScripts
      (respectively).
    </p>
          <br />
          <a style="padding-top:50px; display: block;" name="Hello World">
            <h1 class="page-header">Hello World</h1>
          </a>
          <p>Now let's walk through an complete example so you can see how easy
    it is to create a custom block and assemble a simple page. EDITOR NOTE:
    This should be turned into a video screen capture.</p>
          <p>Create a "MyStuff" folder under the Plugins folder, then right click
    it an select "Add New Item". Next choose "Web User Control", uncheck the
    "Place code in separate file" checkbox and give it the name
    HelloWorld.ascx.</p>
          <p>
        Choose Web User Control and name it HelloWorld.ascx

        
          
            
          
        
      
    <div class="well" style="background-color: white"><img src="images/HelloWorld/WebUserControl.png" /><br /><br /><caption><em styl="small">Figure: Choose Web User Control and name it HelloWorld.ascx</em></caption></div></p>
          <p>
    Add the Inherits="Rock.Web.UI.Block"
    string in the first Control line and type your Hello World as HTML as
    shown in the screenshot. Note: If you're using
    code-behind file (*.ascx.cs) you'll need to change the inheritance in the
    *.cs file instead.</p>
          <p>
      
        The complete HelloWorld.ascx block

        
          
            
          
        
      
    <div class="well" style="background-color: white"><img src="images/HelloWorld/HelloWorldASCX.png" /><br /><br /><caption><em styl="small">Figure: The complete HelloWorld.ascx block</em></caption></div></p>
          <p>Now open Rock ChMS and login as an Administrator. Next, navigate to
    a test page and then choose the "Page Zones" icon from the toolbar in the
    bottom right corner. This is how you add Blocks to the Zones on a page.
    Select the Content zone's Zone Blocks as shown
    here:</p>
          <p>
        Editing the zones on a page

        
          
            
          
        
      
    <div class="well" style="background-color: white"><img src="images/HelloWorld/AddingABlockToAZone.png" /><br /><br /><caption><em styl="small">Figure: Editing the zones on a page</em></caption></div></p>
          <p>  
    Select the Add New button from the dialog box that appears.
    Doing this will search for all registered blocks and also will register
    any new blocks, including the new HelloWorld block you just created.
    Select your HelloWorld block Type and give it a name on this page.</p>
          <p>
        Adding a block to a page zone

        
          
            
          
        
      Once the page is refreshed, you will see an instance of your
    block on the page.<div class="well" style="background-color: white"><img src="images/HelloWorld/AddHelloWorldBlock.png" /><br /><br /><caption><em styl="small">Figure: Adding a block to a page zone</em></caption></div></p>
          <p>
        A test page showing an instance of your HelloWorld
        block

        
          
            
          
        
      <div class="well" style="background-color: white"><img src="images/HelloWorld/FinalPage.png" /><br /><br /><caption><em styl="small">Figure: A test page showing an instance of your HelloWorld
        block</em></caption></div></p>
          <br />
          <a style="padding-top:50px; display: block;" name="Pages">
            <h1 class="page-header">Pages</h1>
          </a>
          <p>TBD</p>
          <br />
